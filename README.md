A legacy project I was working on quite some time ago (check last commit time, lol). Not completely finished, but a POC of how one would modify the GameObjects in Clone Hero to configure custom menus. I used my old UnityLoader that I made before Bep and Melon took over as the main mod drivers for Unity. Feel free to use this code, all I ask is a simple mention in credits. Thanks and enjoy!
